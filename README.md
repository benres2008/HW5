# HW5

This was created to act as a daily calender. I set up the HTML pretty easily and I understood the format of variables and textboxes and other items, but in the end I really struggled with console logging and saving the user's input after the page refreshed. I was unable to save the user's input in the end, so I will definitely tneed to go into office hours to review how to do local storage and I will watch YouTube videos on it to try and understand it better. But besides that part, I felt pretty confident doing everything else. I just could not get the storage part right. 

Installation: There is no required installation.

Usage: Enter text into calender and press button to save info
